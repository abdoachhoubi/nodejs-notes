# Local Modules

In large projects, putting all your code in a single file is not a good idea. As you add more code, youâ€™ll want to stay organized and break your Node.js app into multiple scripts that all work together. For that purpose, we can create local (user-defined) modules in our application.

Modules can be organized in a single file or a collection of multiple files/folders. Almost all programmers prefer modules because of their reusability throughout the application and ability to reduce the complexity of code into smaller pieces.

## Export a module

Let's start by creating a new folder and naming it `modules`, and then create a new JS file `greet.js`. Now We can export javascript code written on this file using `module.exports`. In the code below a function `greet` is defined and assigned to the `module.exports`.

`greet.js:`

```js
const greet = (name) => {
  console.log(`Hi ${name}! How are you doing?`);
};
module.exports = greet;
```

## Import a local module

Now we need to import the local module file into main.js. `require()` function is also used for importing the local modules. All you need to do is provide `require()` with a relative `path` to the script you want to load.

`main.js:`

```js
const greet = require("./modules/greet.js"); // IMPORTING "greet" MODULE

greet("Abdo");
/* ------ OUTPUT ------ 
    > Hi Abdo!
    > How are you doing?
*/
```
